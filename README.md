Project Summary
This project demonstrates basic MongoDB operations using Node.js. The program performs the following tasks:

Insert Operations:

Uses insertOne to add two documents to a collection.
Uses insertMany to insert ten documents, ensuring that five of them have an age field set to 27.
Data Retrieval & Filtering:

Uses find to retrieve all documents where age = 27 and counts the total number of matching documents.
Uses limit to display only the first three documents where age = 27.
